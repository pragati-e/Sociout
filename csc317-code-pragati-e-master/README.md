## Purpose : Developed a website with a mixture of Java, CSS, and HTML as a part of my coursework (Web Software Development) where people can connect with each other, upload images, also get likes and comments on their images from other users. The website content consists of logging in, registering, and post an image which we can be publicly seen on the dashboard. User can create an account by entering their credentials such as first name, last name, date of birth, email, and password. User must enter their password twice to confirm and make system recognize their credentials when they login. The data retrieved from the user activities of the website is stored in the SQL database taking advantage of its security and data privacy.
